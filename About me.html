                <p>Hi! My name is Hüseyincan ALCAN, a passionate beginner web developer and survival enthusiast. I created this website to share my knowledge and experiences about surviving in challenging environments. My goal is to provide valuable resources and tips to help others thrive in similar situations. I've always wanted to have access to a website or application that provides endless survival information from first aid to poisinous plants and snakes. So, I decided to build one myself! Feel free to explore the site and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Wish you good luck!
